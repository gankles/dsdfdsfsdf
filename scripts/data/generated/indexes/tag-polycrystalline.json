    "overview": "Polycrystalline solar panels are made from multiple silicon crystals melted together. They are known for their blue hue and are generally less expensive to produce than monocrystalline panels. The manufacturing process results in a lower efficiency but offers a good balance between cost and performance for residential and commercial applications.",
    "benefits": [
      "Lower manufacturing cost compared to monocrystalline solar panels, making them more affordable for consumers.",
      "Good performance in high-temperature conditions, which can be beneficial in warmer climates.",
      "Sustainable option as they are made from reused silicon, reducing waste in the production process."
    ],
    "considerations": [
      "Typically lower efficiency rates (around 15-17%) compared to monocrystalline panels, which can affect the total energy output.",
      "The larger physical size of polycrystalline panels may require more roof space for installation.",
      "Performance can be slightly affected by shading compared to monocrystalline panels, making placement important for maximizing output."
    ],
    "trends": "Polycrystalline solar panels are seeing a resurgence in popularity due to their affordability and the increasing efficiency of newer models. As technology advances, manufacturers are improving the performance levels of polycrystalline panels, making them a more attractive option for budget-conscious consumers. Additionally, the push for sustainable manufacturing practices is enhancing their appeal in the market.",
