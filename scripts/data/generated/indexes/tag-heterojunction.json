    "overview": "Heterojunction Solar Panels (HJT) combine crystalline silicon and thin-film technologies to enhance efficiency and performance. This technology involves layering a thin film of amorphous silicon on the surface of crystalline silicon cells, which reduces recombination losses and improves light absorption, thereby increasing overall energy conversion efficiency.",
    "benefits": [
      "Higher efficiency rates compared to traditional solar panels, often exceeding 21%.",
      "Better performance in low-light conditions and higher temperature tolerance.",
      "Reduced degradation rates, leading to longer lifespans and reliable energy production."
    ],
    "considerations": [
      "Typically higher initial costs than conventional solar panels.",
      "Availability may be limited compared to more established solar technologies.",
      "Installation may require specialized knowledge and skills due to the unique characteristics of HJT panels."
    ],
    "trends": "The Heterojunction technology is gaining traction in the solar market due to advancements in manufacturing processes and increasing demand for high-efficiency panels. Future trends indicate ongoing research aimed at further improving efficiency and reducing costs, making HJT panels a more accessible option for residential and commercial applications.",
