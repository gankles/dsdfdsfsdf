    "overview": "High-power solar panels are designed to generate more electricity per square meter than standard photovoltaic panels, making them ideal for both residential and commercial applications where space is limited. These panels typically feature advanced technologies that enhance their efficiency and power output, allowing for greater energy production and improved overall performance.",
    "benefits": [
      "Higher energy output per panel, reducing the number of panels needed for a given application.",
      "Space efficiency, making them suitable for rooftops and sites with limited installation area.",
      "Improved performance under low light conditions due to advanced solar cell technology."
    ],
    "considerations": [
      "Initial cost may be higher compared to standard panels, requiring an assessment of the return on investment.",
      "Compatibility with existing systems should be evaluated to ensure optimal performance.",
      "The weight of high-power panels can be greater than standard ones, which may necessitate structural considerations for installation."
    ],
    "trends": "The market for high-power solar panels is growing, driven by advancements in solar cell technologies, such as bifacial and PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell) designs. Future trends indicate a push towards even greater efficiency and power outputs, alongside a reduction in production costs. As energy demands increase, high-power panels are becoming a preferred choice for both utility-scale and residential solar energy projects.",
