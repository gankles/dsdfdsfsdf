    "overview": "Cadmium-telluride (CdTe) solar panels are a type of thin-film solar technology that utilizes cadmium and tellurium to create photovoltaic material. They are known for their efficiency in converting sunlight into electricity while being less expensive to produce compared to traditional silicon-based panels. CdTe panels are particularly effective in high-temperature environments and have a lower carbon footprint during manufacturing.",
    "benefits": [
      "Lower production costs compared to silicon-based solar panels.",
      "Better performance in high temperatures and partial shading conditions.",
      "Smaller physical footprints due to the thin-film design, allowing for flexible installation options."
    ],
    "considerations": [
      "Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal, raising environmental and health concerns regarding disposal and recycling.",
      "Generally lower efficiency rates (around 10-18%) compared to some high-efficiency silicon panels.",
      "Limited availability and fewer manufacturers compared to crystalline silicon panels."
    ],
    "trends": "The market for CdTe solar panels is seeing growth, driven by advancements in manufacturing processes that enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Additionally, increasing demand for sustainable energy solutions and recycling programs for cadmium-telluride panels are emerging, addressing environmental concerns.",
