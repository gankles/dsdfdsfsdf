    "overview": "Polycrystalline solar panels are made from multiple silicon crystals melted together, making them a cost-effective option for solar energy generation. They are known for their unique blue hue and are typically less expensive to produce compared to their monocrystalline counterparts. These panels are widely used in residential and commercial solar systems due to their balance between cost and efficiency.",
    "benefits": [
      "Lower manufacturing costs lead to reduced prices for consumers.",
      "Good performance in high-temperature conditions compared to monocrystalline panels.",
      "Durable and reliable, with a typical lifespan of 25 years or more."
    ],
    "considerations": [
      "Generally lower efficiency (around 15-20%) compared to monocrystalline panels, which may require more space for installation.",
      "Performance can decline more significantly in low-light conditions.",
      "Aesthetic appeal may be less favorable due to their bluish color and less uniform appearance."
    ],
    "trends": "The market for polycrystalline solar panels is evolving with advancements in technology leading to improved efficiency and performance metrics. There is a growing interest in hybrid systems that combine polycrystalline panels with other energy generation technologies. As manufacturing processes improve, the costs are expected to decrease further, making solar energy more accessible.",
