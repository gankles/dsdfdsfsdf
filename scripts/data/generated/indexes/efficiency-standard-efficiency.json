    "overview": "Standard Efficiency Solar Panels are solar photovoltaic (PV) systems that convert sunlight into electricity with efficiency ratings ranging from 15.0% to 18.0%. These panels are widely used in residential and commercial applications due to their balance of cost and performance. They provide a reliable energy source, making them a popular choice for many consumers looking to reduce their energy bills and carbon footprint.",
    "benefits": [
      "Cost-effective option compared to higher efficiency panels, making solar energy accessible to more consumers.",
      "Widely available with a variety of brands and models to choose from.",
      "Sufficient performance for most residential and small commercial applications, providing good energy output."
    ],
    "considerations": [
      "While they are less expensive, they may require more panels to achieve the same output as higher efficiency models, potentially increasing installation space requirements.",
      "Standard efficiency panels may not perform as well in low-light conditions compared to high-efficiency panels.",
      "The return on investment may take longer, especially in areas with lower solar irradiance."
    ],
    "trends": "The market for standard efficiency solar panels is seeing a steady demand, especially in regions where cost is a major concern. As technology advances, improvements in manufacturing processes are enhancing the performance of these panels. However, there is a growing trend towards higher efficiency panels, which may lead to a gradual decline in the popularity of standard efficiency models in the long term.",
