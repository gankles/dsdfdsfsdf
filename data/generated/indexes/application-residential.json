    "overview": "Solar panels for residential use are specifically designed to convert sunlight into electricity for home applications. These panels are typically installed on rooftops or in yards, providing a renewable energy source that can significantly reduce electricity bills and carbon footprints. They come in various types, including monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin-film, each with distinct characteristics suited for different residential needs.",
    "benefits": [
      "Reduced electricity bills through self-generated power.",
      "Increased property value as homes with solar panels are often more attractive to buyers.",
      "Environmental benefits by reducing reliance on fossil fuels and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions."
    ],
    "considerations": [
      "Roof orientation and shading can impact the efficiency of solar panels, so proper site evaluation is essential.",
      "Initial installation costs can be significant, although financial incentives and tax credits may be available.",
      "Choosing the right type of panel based on efficiency, aesthetics, and warranty is crucial for long-term satisfaction."
    ],
    "trends": "The current trend in residential solar panels includes the increasing adoption of high-efficiency monocrystalline panels, advancements in energy storage solutions, and the integration of smart technology to optimize energy consumption. The future outlook indicates a continued decline in costs, with more homeowners investing in solar as energy independence becomes a priority.",
