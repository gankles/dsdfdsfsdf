    "overview": "Polycrystalline solar panels are made from multiple silicon crystals melted together, which gives them a speckled blue hue. They are known for their cost-effectiveness and decent efficiency, making them a popular choice for residential and commercial solar installations. While they typically have a lower efficiency compared to monocrystalline panels, they perform well in higher temperatures and have a relatively low manufacturing cost.",
    "benefits": [
      "Lower cost compared to monocrystalline solar panels, making them more accessible for budget-conscious consumers.",
      "Good performance in high-temperature conditions, which helps maintain efficiency in warm climates.",
      "Environmentally friendly production process, as they use less pure silicon compared to monocrystalline panels."
    ],
    "considerations": [
      "Generally lower efficiency ratings (around 15-20%) compared to monocrystalline panels, which may require more panels to achieve the same power output.",
      "Slightly larger space requirement due to lower efficiency, which may be a concern for installations with limited roof space.",
      "Performance can decrease slightly in low-light conditions compared to monocrystalline options."
    ],
    "trends": "The market for polycrystalline solar panels has seen a stable demand due to their affordability. Innovations in manufacturing processes are improving the efficiency of these panels, making them a more competitive option. As solar technology advances, there is a growing interest in hybrid systems that combine different types of solar panels for optimized performance.",
