    "overview": "Standard Efficiency Solar Panels are solar modules that typically feature efficiency ratings ranging from 15.0% to 18.0%. These panels are designed for residential and commercial applications, providing a balance between cost, performance, and energy production. They are suitable for various installations, particularly where space is not a constraint.",
    "benefits": [
      "More affordable than high-efficiency panels, making them a cost-effective option for many buyers.",
      "Widely available and compatible with standard solar installations, ensuring easy integration.",
      "Sufficient energy output for average household needs, particularly in areas with ample sunlight."
    ],
    "considerations": [
      "Lower efficiency compared to high-efficiency panels may require more space for installation to produce the same amount of energy.",
      "Performance can be affected by shading and orientation, so careful site assessment is necessary.",
      "Long-term energy savings may be lower compared to higher-efficiency panels, impacting return on investment."
    ],
    "trends": "The market for Standard Efficiency Solar Panels is evolving with innovations in materials and manufacturing processes, leading to improved performance and reliability. While high-efficiency panels are gaining popularity, Standard Efficiency panels remain a solid choice due to their affordability. As solar technology advances, we expect a gradual increase in the efficiency of these panels as well.",
