    "overview": "Large-format solar panels are high-capacity photovoltaic modules designed to maximize energy output while minimizing installation space. These panels typically feature advanced technologies, such as half-cut cell designs and PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell) technology, allowing them to achieve higher efficiencies and wattages than standard panels.",
    "benefits": [
      "Higher energy output per panel, reducing the number of panels needed for installation.",
      "Space-efficient, making them ideal for commercial and industrial applications with limited rooftop or ground space.",
      "Advanced technology integration provides improved performance in low light and high-temperature conditions."
    ],
    "considerations": [
      "Weight and size may require additional structural support or specialized mounting systems during installation.",
      "Compatibility with existing systems should be evaluated, as large-format panels may require specific inverters or wiring.",
      "Higher initial cost per panel compared to standard-sized panels, which may impact budget considerations."
    ],
    "trends": "The market for large-format solar panels is experiencing growth due to increasing demand for efficient energy solutions in commercial sectors. Innovations in panel design and energy density are driving the development of even larger formats, enhancing their attractiveness for utility-scale deployments. As manufacturing processes improve, costs are expected to decrease, making these panels more accessible for a wider range of applications.",
