    "overview": "Residential solar panels are specifically designed for use in home installations, providing homeowners with a reliable and efficient way to harness solar energy. These panels come in various types, including monocrystalline and polycrystalline, to suit different energy needs and budgets. They are essential for reducing electricity bills, decreasing carbon footprints, and enhancing energy independence.",
    "benefits": [
      "Lower electricity bills by generating your own power.",
      "Increase home value through energy-efficient upgrades.",
      "Reduce reliance on the grid and enhance energy independence.",
      "Government incentives and tax credits can make installation more affordable.",
      "Environmentally friendly, reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
    ],
    "considerations": [
      "Assess the roof's orientation, angle, and shading to determine solar potential.",
      "Consider the type of solar panel (monocrystalline vs. polycrystalline) based on efficiency and budget.",
      "Evaluate local regulations and incentives that may impact installation and costs.",
      "Calculate the size of the system needed based on household energy consumption.",
      "Research reputable installers and warranties for product reliability."
    ],
    "trends": "The residential solar market is seeing an increase in demand for high-efficiency panels, such as those using advanced technologies like PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell). There is also a growing trend towards energy storage solutions, allowing homeowners to store excess energy generated during the day for use at night. Additionally, solar leasing and power purchase agreements (PPAs) are gaining popularity, allowing homeowners to adopt solar without high upfront costs.",

      {
        "question": "How much energy can residential solar panels produce?",
        "answer": "The energy production depends on the system size and local sunlight conditions, but a typical 5 kW system can generate about 6,000 to 8,000 kWh per year."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the differences between monocrystalline and polycrystalline panels?",
        "answer": "Monocrystalline panels are generally more efficient and take up less space, while polycrystalline panels are usually less expensive but have lower efficiency."

      {
        "question": "Do residential solar panels require maintenance?",
        "answer": "Yes, they require minimal maintenance, such as periodic cleaning and inspections, but they are generally very low-maintenance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I install solar panels myself, or do I need a professional?",
        "answer": "While some homeowners opt for DIY installations, it is recommended to hire a professional to ensure proper installation, compliance with local codes, and optimal system performance."
