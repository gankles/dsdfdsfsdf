    "overview": "Cadmium-telluride (CdTe) solar panels are a type of thin-film solar technology that utilizes cadmium and tellurium to create a photovoltaic layer. These panels are known for their lower manufacturing costs compared to traditional silicon-based solar panels and are increasingly used in large-scale solar farms due to their efficiency in converting sunlight into electricity, especially in low-light conditions.",
    "benefits": [
      "Lower manufacturing costs compared to crystalline silicon panels, making them more affordable for large-scale installations.",
      "Better performance in high temperatures and partial shading, which can lead to higher energy yields in certain environments.",
      "Lightweight and flexible, allowing for easier installation and integration into various surfaces, including building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems."
    ],
    "considerations": [
      "Cadmium-telluride panels contain cadmium, a toxic heavy metal, raising environmental concerns regarding their disposal and recycling.",
      "Typically, CdTe panels have a lower efficiency rate (around 18%) compared to monocrystalline silicon panels (up to 22% or more), which may require more space for installation to achieve the same energy output.",
      "The longevity and performance degradation rates can vary, and potential buyers should consider warranties and long-term performance guarantees when choosing these panels."
    ],
    "trends": "The market for cadmium-telluride solar panels is growing, especially in utility-scale applications. Advances in manufacturing processes continue to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Additionally, recycling technologies for CdTe panels are being developed to address environmental concerns, making them more sustainable in the long run.",
